# Aurora Web App - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# Backend API URL (Server-side only - used by API proxy routes)
# This is NOT exposed to the client browser
# For local development with local backend:
# BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8443
# For production (already set in code):
# BACKEND_URL=https://windowsserver.taildbc5d3.ts.net

# Note: The frontend now uses /api/* routes which are proxied by Vercel serverless functions
